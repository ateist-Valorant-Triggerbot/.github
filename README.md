# Valorant Triggerbot – Shoot First, Think Later 🔫🧠

In *Valorant*, milliseconds matter. Blink and you’re already in the kill feed. If your reflexes aren’t cracked like a Radiant’s, the **Triggerbot** is your silent MVP. It doesn’t snap like an aimbot, it doesn’t glow like ESP — it just **fires the moment your crosshair touches a valid hitbox**. No clicking, no thinking, just instant reaction.

Perfect for **snipers, lurkers, and entry demons**, this cheat feels **natural**, works with legit configs, and keeps your frags high and your suspicions low.

## 💡 What Is a Valorant Triggerbot?

A **triggerbot** automatically shoots your weapon the moment your crosshair crosses over an enemy. Whether you’re holding an angle with the Operator or flicking with a Vandal, the bot detects hitboxes and pulls the trigger **without needing to click** — saving you reaction time and giving **robotic consistency**.

It’s fully customizable for **head-only**, **visible-only**, and **delayed reaction** to look 100% legit on streams or recordings.
